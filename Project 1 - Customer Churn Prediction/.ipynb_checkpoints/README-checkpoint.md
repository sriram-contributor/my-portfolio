## Introduction
This project focuses on Customer Churn Prediction, a common and critical challenge for many businesses.

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or stop using its services or products. For instance, a customer might cancel a subscription, close an account, or simply stop making purchases.

Predicting customer churn is highly important for businesses because acquiring new customers is often significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, businesses can proactively take targeted actions to retain them. These actions might include offering special discounts, providing better customer support, or suggesting more suitable products/services. This helps in maintaining revenue streams, improving customer satisfaction, and gaining a competitive edge.

The overall aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can analyze historical customer data (such as their usage patterns, demographics, and account information) to predict the likelihood of a customer churning in the near future. This predictive model can then serve as a tool for businesses to implement effective customer retention strategies.

## Problem Statement
The primary problem this project addresses is the financial and operational impact of customer churn on businesses. Losing customers leads to revenue loss, increased marketing costs for acquiring new customers, and can negatively affect brand reputation.

Therefore, the specific problem this project aims to solve is: To develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately identifying customers who are at a high risk of churning, based on their historical data and interactions with the service/product.

By effectively predicting churn, the business can proactively engage with at-risk customers through targeted retention strategies, thereby minimizing customer attrition and maximizing long-term profitability.

## Dataset
* **Source:** [Where did you get the dataset from? e.g., Kaggle, a specific company, a public API. Provide a link if possible.]
* **Description:** [Briefly describe the dataset. How many rows/columns? What do the features (columns) represent? What is the target variable (e.g., a column named 'Churn' with 'Yes'/'No' or 1/0 values)?]
* **Example Features:** `[e.g., Tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Contract, PaymentMethod, Gender, SeniorCitizen, etc.]`
* **Target Variable:** `[e.g., Churn (Yes/No or 1/0)]`

## Project Goals
[List the specific objectives of your project. For example:]
* To perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior and identify factors influencing churn.
* To preprocess the data effectively for model training.
* To build and compare various classification models for churn prediction.
* To evaluate the models based on relevant metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
* To identify the most important features that contribute to customer churn.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
[Explain how the data was obtained. If you downloaded it, mention that. If you used an API, describe it briefly.]

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
[Describe the key insights you found during EDA. What patterns did you observe? Did you use visualizations? Mention any interesting charts or findings. For example: "Visualized churn rate against contract type, showing customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn."]
*(Simple meaning: What did you find out by looking at the data before building the model?)*

### Data Preprocessing
[Detail the steps taken to clean and prepare the data for modeling. For example:]
* Handling missing values: `[e.g., Imputed with mean/median/mode, or rows removed]`
* Encoding categorical features: `[e.g., One-Hot Encoding for nominal features, Label Encoding for ordinal features]`
* Feature scaling: `[e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler applied to numerical features]`
* Feature engineering (if any): `[e.g., Created new features from existing ones]`
* Splitting the data: `[e.g., Train-test split ratio like 80:20]`

### Model Building
[List the machine learning models you experimented with. For example:]
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
[Mention if you performed hyperparameter tuning and which techniques you used (e.g., GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).]

### Model Evaluation
[Describe how you evaluated your models. List the metrics used and why they are relevant for a churn problem (which is often an imbalanced classification problem). For example:]
* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall (Sensitivity)
* F1-Score
* ROC Curve and AUC Score
* Confusion Matrix
