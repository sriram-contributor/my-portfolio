## Introduction
[Provide a brief overview of the project. What is customer churn? Why is it important for businesses to predict it? What is the overall aim of this project?]
*(Simple meaning: What is the project about in simple words?)*

---

## Problem Statement
[Clearly define the problem this project aims to solve. For example: "To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn (stop using a service/product) based on their past behavior and demographic data."]
*(Simple meaning: What specific question are you trying to answer with this project?)*

---

## Dataset
* **Source:** [Where did you get the dataset from? e.g., Kaggle, a specific company, a public API. Provide a link if possible.]
* **Description:** [Briefly describe the dataset. How many rows/columns? What do the features (columns) represent? What is the target variable (e.g., a column named 'Churn' with 'Yes'/'No' or 1/0 values)?]
* **Example Features:** `[e.g., Tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Contract, PaymentMethod, Gender, SeniorCitizen, etc.]`
* **Target Variable:** `[e.g., Churn (Yes/No or 1/0)]`

---

## Project Goals
[List the specific objectives of your project. For example:]
* To perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior and identify factors influencing churn.
* To preprocess the data effectively for model training.
* To build and compare various classification models for churn prediction.
* To evaluate the models based on relevant metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
* To identify the most important features that contribute to customer churn.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
[Explain how the data was obtained. If you downloaded it, mention that. If you used an API, describe it briefly.]

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
[Describe the key insights you found during EDA. What patterns did you observe? Did you use visualizations? Mention any interesting charts or findings. For example: "Visualized churn rate against contract type, showing customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn."]
*(Simple meaning: What did you find out by looking at the data before building the model?)*

### Data Preprocessing
[Detail the steps taken to clean and prepare the data for modeling. For example:]
* Handling missing values: `[e.g., Imputed with mean/median/mode, or rows removed]`
* Encoding categorical features: `[e.g., One-Hot Encoding for nominal features, Label Encoding for ordinal features]`
* Feature scaling: `[e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler applied to numerical features]`
* Feature engineering (if any): `[e.g., Created new features from existing ones]`
* Splitting the data: `[e.g., Train-test split ratio like 80:20]`

### Model Building
[List the machine learning models you experimented with. For example:]
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
[Mention if you performed hyperparameter tuning and which techniques you used (e.g., GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).]

### Model Evaluation
[Describe how you evaluated your models. List the metrics used and why they are relevant for a churn problem (which is often an imbalanced classification problem). For example:]
* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall (Sensitivity)
* F1-Score
* ROC Curve and AUC Score
* Confusion Matrix

    * `[e.g., NumPy (for numerical operations)]`
    * `[e.g., Scikit-learn (for machine learning models, preprocessing, metrics)]`
    * `[e.g., Matplotlib (for plotting)]`
    * `[e.g., Seaborn (for statistical visualizations)]`
    * `[e.g., Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development)]`
    * `[Add any other specific libraries you used, like XGBoost, LightGBM, imbalanced-learn]`

## Installation
[Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project environment and install dependencies.]
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sriram-contributor/my-portfolio.git](https://github.com/sriram-contributor/my-portfolio.git)
    cd my-portfolio/"Project 1 - Customer Churn Prediction"
    ```
2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file. You can generate one by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your project's virtual environment after installing all necessary libraries.)*
